# Low Light Image Enhancement Project

**Introduction** 
In recent years, deep learning has revolutionised the field of image processing, particularly in enhancing low-light images. This report presents a project that implements a Convolutional Blind Denoising Network (CBDNet) to address the challenges posed by noisy images captured in low-light conditions and a image post processing method to tackle low light situations and colour correction. CBDNet is designed to first estimate the noise present in the image and then perform non-blind denoising to enhance the image quality. The model's performance is evaluated using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metric, a widely used indicator of image quality.
